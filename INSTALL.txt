You'll run Clojure via a program named `Leiningen`. Clojure itself is
a Java jar file. It, along with any Clojure packages you use, should
be stored in a Maven repository in your home directory. To do the
exercises, you'll have to install Leiningen and make sure the Maven
repo has all the required jar files. There are four cases, depending
on whether you already have Leiningen installed and whether this
hotel's network is working.

Note: I've assumed most people will have Unix laptops (Linux or
Macs). I don't have installation instructions for Windows. Sorry.
I suggest you pair up with a Unix person.

All the instructions below assume you installed the workshop directory
into `Desktop/lambda-jam`. Adjust as necessary. They also assume
you've changed your current working directory to the root of the
contents:

   % cd ~/Desktop/lambda-jam


====== You already have Leiningen installed AND the network is available.

1. Give `lein midje` a trial run:

       % cd robozzle 
       % lein midje

   You should see this message:

       FAIL "It works end-to-end." at (core.clj:14)
       Actual result did not agree with the checking function.
               Actual result: false
           Checking function: truthy
       FAILURE: 1 check failed.  (But 1 succeeded.)
       Subprocess failed

   You may see this instead:

       ^[[31mFAIL^[[0m "It works end-to-end." at (core.clj:14)
       ...

   That means ANSI color codes aren't working in your terminal. You can turn
   them off like this:

       % export MIDJE_COLORIZE=false


====== You already have Leiningen installed AND the network is NOT available.

1. Do you have an existing Maven repository? (You can check with `ls -ld ~/.m2`.)
   If so, save it:

       % mv ~/.m2 ~/old-maven-repository

2. Replace it with a prepopulated Maven repository:

       % mv network-free-install/m2 ~/.m2 

   (Note that the dot is important.)

3. Give `lein midje` a trial run:

       % cd robozzle 
       % lein midje

   You should see this message:

       FAIL "It works end-to-end." at (core.clj:14)
       Actual result did not agree with the checking function.
               Actual result: false
           Checking function: truthy
       FAILURE: 1 check failed.  (But 1 succeeded.)
       Subprocess failed

   You may see this instead:

       ^[[31mFAIL^[[0m "It works end-to-end." at (core.clj:14)
       ...

   That means ANSI color codes aren't working in your terminal. You can turn
   them off like this:

       % export MIDJE_COLORIZE=false


====== You do NOT have Leiningen installed BUT the network is available.

1. Leiningen installs what it needs when it's first run, but you have to tell
   the shell where it is. The simple way to do that is the following:

       % export PATH=$PATH:~/Desktop/lambda-jam/bin

   (Note: you must do that in each new shell / terminal window you open. You can 
   also add that line to a `~/.bashrc` or equivalent file, if you know how to do that.) 

2. Make leiningen pull down all that it needs.

       % lein 

   You should see messages about downloading, then a list of available tasks.

3. Make leiningen install everything else the exercises need:

       % cd robozzle 
       % lein midje

   You should see this message:

       FAIL "It works end-to-end." at (core.clj:14)
       Actual result did not agree with the checking function.
               Actual result: false
           Checking function: truthy
       FAILURE: 1 check failed.  (But 1 succeeded.)
       Subprocess failed

   You may see this instead:

       ^[[31mFAIL^[[0m "It works end-to-end." at (core.clj:14)
       ...

   That means ANSI color codes aren't working in your terminal. You can turn
   them off like this:

       % export MIDJE_COLORIZE=false


====== You do NOT have Leiningen installed AND the network is NOT available.

1. Tell the shell where Leiningen is. The simple way to do that is the following:

       % export PATH=$PATH:~/Desktop/lambda-jam/bin

   (Note: you must do that in each new shell / terminal window you open. You can 
   also add that line to a `~/.bashrc` or equivalent file, if you know how to do that.) 

2. Do you have an existing Maven repository? (You can check with `ls -ld ~/.m2`.)
   If so, save it:

       % mv ~/.m2 ~/old-maven-repository

3. Replace it with a prepopulated Maven repository:

       % mv network-free-install/m2 ~/.m2 

   (Note that the dot is important.)

4. Leiningen normally initializes itself by downloading files across the network.
   Do its initialization for it:

       % mv network-free-install/lein ~/.lein

   (Note that the dot is important.)

5. Give `lein midje` a trial run:

       % cd robozzle
       % lein midje

   You should see this message:

       FAIL "It works end-to-end." at (core.clj:14)

               Actual result: false

       % export MIDJE_COLORIZE=false
